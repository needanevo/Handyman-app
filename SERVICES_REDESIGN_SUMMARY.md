# Services Section Redesign - Complete âœ…

## Changes Made

### 1. Home Screen Services Section (/app/frontend/app/home.tsx)
**Changed from:** Square grid layout (2 columns) with 6 services
**Changed to:** Full-width list layout with 9 services

#### New Services Added:
- **Roofing** - Leak repairs, shingle replacement (Red icon)
- **HVAC** - AC, heating, maintenance (Purple icon)
- **Appliances** - Repair, installation, service (Dark gray icon)

#### Layout Changes:
- **Width:** Now full width of screen (was 2-column grid)
- **Height:** Shorter buttons (60px vs 120px) - you can now see all 9 services on one screen
- **Design:** List style with icon on left, text in middle, chevron on right

### 2. Quote Request Screen (/app/frontend/app/quote/request.tsx)
**Removed:** Secondary service category button grid
**Added:** Service description card showing:
- Large service icon with colored background
- Service title
- Short description tagline  
- Full detailed description of what's included
- "Change Service" button to go back

#### Description Examples:
- **Drywall:** "Expert drywall repair and installation. We handle small patches, large repairs, texture matching, and full installations. Fast turnaround for holes, cracks, and water damage."
- **Roofing:** "Roofing repair and maintenance including leak detection and repair, shingle replacement, flashing repair, gutter work, and roof inspections. Emergency repairs available."
- **HVAC:** "HVAC services including air conditioning repair, heating system maintenance, filter replacement, thermostat installation, and seasonal tune-ups to keep your system running efficiently."

### 3. New Shared Constants File (/app/frontend/src/constants/services.ts)
- Created centralized service definitions
- All 9 services with icons, colors, descriptions, and full descriptions
- Imported by both home.tsx and quote/request.tsx for consistency

## Files Modified

### Created:
- `/app/frontend/src/constants/services.ts` - Shared service definitions

## Next Steps (For Future)

When you're ready to add the subcontractor database:
1. Add a "View Available Contractors" button in the service description card
2. Link to a new screen showing contractors filtered by service type
3. Contractors can have ratings, availability, and specialties
