        <h1>Contractor Service Agreement</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight-box" role="note">
            <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Independent Contractor Acknowledgement</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>Important:</strong> You are an independent contractor, not an employee. You are
            responsible for your own taxes, insurance, and business expenses. The Real Johnson is a
            lead-generation platform that connects you with customers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Service Provider Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As a service provider on The Real Johnson platform, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain all required licenses, permits, and insurance for your trade and jurisdiction</li>
        <li>Perform work in a professional, workmanlike manner according to industry standards</li>
        <li>Communicate clearly with customers about scope, timing, and any changes to work</li>
        <li>Comply with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations</li>
        <li>Track and report your income and expenses for tax purposes</li>
        <li>Maintain your own liability and workers' compensation insurance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Platform Fee</h2>
    <p>
        The Real Johnson charges a 15% platform fee on the gross payment for each completed job.
        This fee covers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Platform maintenance and operation</li>
        <li>Payment processing and secure escrow</li>
        <li>Customer support and dispute resolution</li>
        <li>Lead generation and job matching</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>
        Payment is released after customer confirms job completion. You receive 85% of the job total
        via direct deposit within 3-5 business days. Funds are held in escrow during work to protect
        both parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Tax Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>You are solely responsible for:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tracking all income earned through the platform</li>
        <li>Paying federal, state, and local income taxes</li>
        <li>Filing quarterly estimated taxes if required</li>
        <li>Self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare)</li>
        <li>Any business licenses or permits required in your area</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Real Johnson provides reports for your records, but these are informational only and
        not official tax documentation. Consult your tax professional.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Insurance & Liability</h2>
    <p>
        You agree to maintain appropriate insurance coverage, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>General liability insurance (recommended minimum $1 million coverage)</li>
        <li>Workers' compensation insurance if you have employees</li>
        <li>Auto insurance for any vehicle used for business purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Real Johnson does not provide insurance coverage for service providers. You are liable
        for any damages, injuries, or losses caused by your work.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Customer Relationships</h2>
    <p>
        The contract for work is between you and the customer. The Real Johnson facilitates the
        connection but is not a party to the work agreement. You deal directly with customers on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scope of work</li>
        <li>Scheduling and timing</li>
        <li>Change orders and additional work</li>
        <li>Quality and completion standards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        Either party may terminate this agreement at any time. You may close your account and stop
        accepting new jobs. The Real Johnson may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of
        Terms of Service, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fraudulent activity</li>
        <li>Repeated customer complaints</li>
        <li>Failure to maintain required licenses or insurance</li>
        <li>Violation of platform policies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
        If a dispute arises between you and a customer regarding work completion or payment, The Real
        Johnson may mediate based on job description, photos, communications, and platform policies.
        Final decisions rest with The Real Johnson.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        The Real Johnson's liability is limited to the platform fee paid for a specific job. We are
        not liable for lost income, business interruption, or any indirect or consequential damages.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Acceptance</h2>
    <p>
        By creating a service provider account, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and
        agree to this Contractor Service Agreement. You confirm that you are an independent contractor,
        not an employee, and are solely responsible for taxes, insurance, and business operations.
