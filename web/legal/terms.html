    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

    <p>
        Welcome to The Real Johnson. By using our platform, you agree to these Terms of Service.
        Please read them carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By accessing or using The Real Johnson platform (website and mobile application), you agree
        to be bound by these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
        The Real Johnson is a platform connecting homeowners with handymen and licensed contractors
        for home service projects. We facilitate the connection but are not a party to the actual
        service agreement between customer and service provider.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for
        all activities that occur under your account. You must be at least 18 years old to create
        an account.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Platform Fee</h2>
    <p>
        The Real Johnson charges service providers a 15% platform fee on completed jobs. This fee
        covers platform operation, payment processing, and customer support.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>
        Customers pay through our secure payment system. Funds are held in escrow until job completion
        is confirmed. Service providers receive payment via direct deposit within 3-5 business days
        after customer confirmation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>
        Users must conduct themselves professionally and legally. Prohibited activities include fraud,
        misrepresentation, harassment, or any violation of local, state, or federal laws.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
        The Real Johnson is a platform only. We do not employ service providers, perform services, or
        guarantee work quality. All work agreements are between customer and service provider.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, The Real Johnson shall not be liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the platform.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the platform after
        changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>
